# Project Alpha

## Environment Variables

The frontend uses the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` variable to configure the base URL for API requests. Create a `.env` file inside the `frontend` directory and set:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

Adjust the value as needed for your environment.
